# HDPE_properties

This file currently creates a linear regression plot for:
- each input and output feature 
- each intermediary and output feature 
- for each blend 50 -100% HDPE content

Run each cell to replicate these results, the notEnough list contains the two features that did not have enough data points to run linear regression, for each blend specified \

To run this for a smaller sample group, remove feature names from the 'listInputs', 'listOutputs' and/ or some HDPE content options from the 'blends' lists
